# Dev Team Six — Portfolio Intelligence & Audit Infrastructure

> Part of [The Penny Lane Project](https://thepennylaneproject.org) — technology that serves the individual.

## What This Is

This repository is the central intelligence and quality-assurance hub for The Penny Lane Project — a portfolio of 11 actively developed applications built by Sarah Sahl. It houses codebase intelligence reports, structured expectations documents, and the LYRA multi-agent audit system that continuously validates each application against its architectural constraints.

## Current Status

**Active** — Codebase intelligence reports and expectations documents are in place for all 11 applications. The LYRA audit system is operational and ready to run against any application in the portfolio.

## The 11 Applications

| Application | Domain | Stack |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Advocera** | Legal-tech | Python / SQLite |
| **Codra** | AI-powered development platform | TypeScript / React / Netlify Functions |
| **FounderOS** | Founder productivity suite | Next.js 14 App Router |
| **Mythos** | AI marketing operations | TypeScript monorepo |
| **Passagr** | Travel visa research | TypeScript / React |
| **Relevnt** | Job market intelligence | TypeScript / React |
| **embr** | Creator monetization | NestJS / Next.js / React Native (Turborepo) |
| **ready** | Career readiness | TypeScript / React / Vite |
| **Dashboard** | Personal medical data | Python / Streamlit |
| **Restoration Project** | Blog & briefing site | Next.js |
| **sarahsahl.pro** | Portfolio site | Static HTML / CSS / JS |

## Deploy stack (dashboard + audits)

- **Dashboard:** Next.js in `dashboard/` — **canonical host: Netlify** (see root `netlify.toml`). `dashboard/vercel.json` is optional/alternate; prefer one host to avoid divergent config.
- **API auth (production):** Set **`DASHBOARD_API_SECRET`** or reuse **`ORCHESTRATION_ENQUEUE_SECRET`**. When set, all `/api/*` routes except **`GET /api/health`** require either a browser login (unlock screen) or `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` / `x-lyra-api-secret`. Netlify scheduled `enqueue-weekly-audit` already sends Bearer for orchestration POST.
- **Health:** `GET /api/health` — public JSON `{ ok: true }` for uptime checks.
- **Observability (optional):** Set **`SENTRY_DSN`** (and **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`** for client) for error monitoring; no DSN = no-op. Optionally set `SENTRY_ORG` and `SENTRY_PROJECT` for source map uploads in CI.
- **Data:** **Supabase Postgres** — run migrations in `supabase/migrations/` (core tables + RLS). RLS locks `lyra_*` for anon/authenticated PostgREST; the app server using `DATABASE_URL` (owner/service role) keeps full access.
- **Worker:** `worker/` — BullMQ (or DB poll) + OpenAI; processes queued audits. See `worker/README.md` and `audits/COPILOT-AGENTS.md`.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — dashboard lint, `tsc --noEmit`, build; worker build.

## Audit System (LYRA)

LYRA is a multi-agent audit system with six specialized agents:

- **Agent A** — Runtime & Logic Bug Hunter
- **Agent B** — Data Integrity / Schema / RLS Auditor
- **Agent C** — UX Flow & Copy Consistency Auditor
- **Agent D** — Performance & Cost Auditor
- **Agent E** — Security & Privacy Auditor
- **Agent F** — Build/Deploy & Observability Auditor

To run an audit session:

```bash
python3 audits/session.py        # What should I do next?
python3 audits/session.py triage # Show prioritized fix list
python3 audits/session.py status # Full dashboard
```

See [`audits/README.md`](audits/README.md) for full documentation.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is the primary way to review audit output, queue repairs, and manage projects without running everything manually.

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

From the dashboard UI, use **Import project** to load `open_findings.json`, then use **sync now** and the project-level repair controls to keep manual work inside the app. UI copy conventions (nav vs actions) are in [`docs/VOICE.md`](docs/VOICE.md).

## Orchestration (Supabase + Netlify + worker)

- **Postgres:** `DATABASE_URL` — projects in `lyra_projects`, jobs in `lyra_audit_jobs`, completed summaries in **`lyra_audit_runs`**, Linear mappings in **`lyra_linear_sync`** when migrations are applied (see `supabase/migrations/`).
- **Enqueue / API gate:** `ORCHESTRATION_ENQUEUE_SECRET` or `DASHBOARD_API_SECRET` — Netlify cron and dashboard POST use Bearer; browser session uses the unlock screen after first load. Client `apiFetch` also sends the orchestration secret from **session storage** when set (same value as the orchestration panel field).
- **Worker:** `worker/` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`, same `DATABASE_URL`, optional `REDIS_URL` for BullMQ. Audits use **sampled** code context (see `worker/README.md`), not a full-repo scan.
- **Weekly schedule:** Netlify function `dashboard/netlify/functions/enqueue-weekly-audit.ts` (Monday 09:00 UTC).
- **Per-project audit history:** Dashboard project view lists recent `lyra_audit_runs` / `lyra_audit_jobs` for that app. `GET /api/orchestration/runs?project=Name` returns the same JSON.

Routing remains env-driven: `LYRA_ROUTING_CONFIG`, `LYRA_ROUTING_STRATEGY`, and `LYRA_*_MODEL` for the dashboard engine view and repair engine.
